livingphysics
=============

Artificial chemistry game. Live version: https://timhutton.github.io/livingphysics/

This was for several years on the Google Play store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.org.livingphysics.app.livingphysics_full

Now ported to the web, which is a much better place for executables, being cross-platform and free.

TODO:

- allow users to make own levels
