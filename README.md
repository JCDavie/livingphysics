History:
 - OrganicBuilder was a version of this idea, written as a Java applet. Lots of people used it, and in 2007 I wrote <a href="http://www.sq3.org.uk/papers/ob_report.pdf">a paper</a> about what they created.
 - A port to Android was made, written in Processing, and was for several years available as an app on the Google Play Store. That had something like 30,000 downloads.
 - Now ported to the web using processing.js
 
 TODO:
 - port to p5.js (a more modern version of processing.js) or to native javascript, or C++ and OpenGL through WebAssembly
 - make the interface more appropriate for the web

Testing locally:
 - Using Python 3: ```python -m http.server 8080``` and then open this URL: http://localhost:8080/
